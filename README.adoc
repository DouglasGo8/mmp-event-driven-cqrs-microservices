== Transaction in Microservices

. ACID Transactions in Monolithic
. Microservice architecture we have each micro is a separated app with this own database/schema, SAGA is a design pattern to keep consistence between microservices, we have to possibilities
.. Choreography-Based: Message Broker centralizing exchange events to complete the success, in case of failures compensation operations/transaction need be performed
.. Orchestration-Based Specific Microservice that explicit Manage a SAGA pipeline, down bellow an Apache Camel SAGA sample using LRA
.. All compensation operations need be used in reversed order

Suppose you want to place a new order, and you have two distinct services in your system: one managing the orders and one managing the credit. Logically you can place an order if you have enough credit for it.

With the Saga EIP you can model the direct:buy route as a Saga composed of two distinct actions, one to create the order and one to take the credit. Both actions must be executed, or none of them: an order placed without credit can be considered an inconsistent outcome (and a payment without an order).

class MyRouter extends RouteBuilder {
  @Override
  public void configure() {
    from("direct:buy")
      .saga()
        .to("direct:newOrder")
        .to("direct:reserveCredit");

    from("direct:newOrder")
      .saga()
        .propagation(SagaPropagation.MANDATORY)
          .compensation("direct:cancelOrder")
        .transform().header(Exchange.SAGA_LONG_RUNNING_ACTION)
        .bean(orderManagerService, "newOrder")
        .log("Order ${body} created");

    from("direct:cancelOrder")
      .transform().header(Exchange.SAGA_LONG_RUNNING_ACTION)
      .bean(orderManagerService, "cancelOrder")
      .log("Order ${body} cancelled");

  }

. Eventuate
. Axon

== Command-Query Responsibility Segregation

. Commands - createSomething(Product p) / POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH
. Query - findSomething(String id) / GET
